# TwoTwice
The task: 
To write a function that determines which elements are present twice in each of the arrays (twice = two or more times in each array). Two arrays are given as input. The output is an array with the necessary matches. For example: on input [7, 17, 1, 9, 1, 17, 56, 56, 23]; [56, 17, 17, 17, 1, 23, 34, 23, 1, 8, 1]; on the output [1, 17].
